# Object Detection Web App using Streamlit and YOLOv5

This project provides a simple Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload an image and perform object detection using the YOLOv5s model.

## Features
- Upload and visualize your own image
- Detect objects using pretrained YOLOv5s
- Run entirely on Google Colab with GPU support
- Accessible via public URL using `localtunnel`

## Tech Stack
- Streamlit
- PyTorch
- YOLOv5 (via Ultralytics)
- pyngrok/localtunnel for public URL access

> Ensure GPU is enabled on Google Colab for optimal performance.
